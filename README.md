# Hangman Game in Python

## 🎯 About the Project

This is a simple command-line Hangman game built using Python. The player has to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of tries. The game provides hints using underscores, and incorrect guesses lead to a visual representation of a hangman being drawn.

## 🛠 Features

- Random word selection
- Hint display with underscores
- Tracking of guessed letters
- Limited attempts with a hangman visual
- User-friendly console interaction

## 📌 How to Play

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. The game will randomly select a word and display its hidden representation (\_ \_ \_ \_).
3. Guess one letter at a time.
4. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the hint.
5. If the guess is incorrect, the hangman drawing progresses.
6. The game ends when you guess the word correctly or run out of tries.
